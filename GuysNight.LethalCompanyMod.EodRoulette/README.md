# Gameplay

This mod allows players to interact with landmines in an attempt to disable them. Successful interaction will result in
the landmine being permanently disarmed, removing the threat from your path. However, the process of disarming is
fraught with danger. There's a random chance that your attempt to disarm the landmine might trigger an explosion
instead!

EOD Roulette is not just a mod, it's a test of your courage, decision-making, and your luck. Will you step up to the
challenge and become the ultimate deminer in Lethal Company?

# Configurable Chance

The element of chance is what makes EOD Roulette a thrilling addition to your Lethal Company game. The probability of
triggering an explosion during the disarmament attempt is not fixed. As a player, you have the power to configure this
probability, adding a layer of strategy to your gameplay. Will you play it safe or will you dare to defy the odds?
