## Known Issues / Roadmap
1. The mod is currently a client-side only mod. The item values are changed for you only, and not for anyone that you are playing with. We plan to address this eventually.
2. (Potentially) If there is enough demand, we'll look to make these values driven by a config file that you can modify.
