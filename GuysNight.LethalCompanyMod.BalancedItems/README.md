# Introduction
Balanced Items is a simple mod designed to give more realistic weights and values to all of the items in Lethal Company.
This mod includes item adjustments for all scrap/loot items as well as those purchasable from the terminal.

# Adjustments
## Scrap
> The values listed below are the average value that the item will be worth. The min/max values are +/- 20% from this average value.
> These values are currently the average vanilla value, just with a tighter variance of the min and max values.

## Known Issues / Roadmap
1. The mod is currently a client-side only mod. The item values are changed for you only, and not for anyone that you are playing with. We plan to address this eventually.
2. (Potentially) If there is enough demand, we'll look to make these values driven by a config file that you can modify.
