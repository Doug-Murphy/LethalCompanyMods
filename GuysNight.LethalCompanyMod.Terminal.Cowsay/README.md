## Known Issues / Roadmap / Oddities

1. The TerminalApi mod does not support asynchronous methods for displaying text in the terminal screen. Therefore, this
   mod freezes the game's thread while fetching the text to display. Fortunately, it should only take 1-2 seconds at
   most so long as you have ok internet!
